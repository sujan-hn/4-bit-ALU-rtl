# 4-bit-ALU-rtl
implementation of a 4 bit ALU on a basys 3 fpga board using vivado design suite
ALU operations{add,sub,mul,and2,or2,nand2,xor2,nor2) are performed.
the simulation files(screenshots) are attached .
the implementation of a few opcodes is shown in the "alu_mp4" video file, where (A="1010", B="0101").
